    <u><h1>ABOUT US</h1></u><br>
   <p> Location-wise ECMT has one of the most beautiful campus in this part of India. Situated in rolling parkland on the edge of Barasat,

the campus combines award-deserving architecture with green open spaces. The campus is surrounded by pollution-free Park / play ground - just a few minutes away from the lively city.

The ECMT Campus fuses together a number of creative and business disciplines and is located at the heart of booming creative surroundings.

From its foundation, ECMT has had an international perspective to its academic activities and its outlook. Our forward looking academic / industry-oriented teaching tackles Major Indian and global issues, with leading areas of expertise. ECMT has extensive links with many institutions.</p>

<p>We, at ECMT believe in establishing a long tradition of engaging with business and the community, which could continue through activities such as Innovation Centre, public lectures and service to the community. Our goal is to help businesses and organizations in the region in particular and develop higher staff skill levels through training, and to stimulate innovation through partnership with other institutions outside ECMT to benefit the wider society.</p>

 

<p>Such an Innovation Centre could provide support for the creation and growth of technology as well as skill- knowledge-based companies. The Centre, we firmly believe, would be able to create thriving business environment for forward-looking companies.</p>
